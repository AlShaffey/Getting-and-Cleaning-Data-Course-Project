Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The above-mentioned data has been collected, processed, cleaned, and summarized with the below information:

The data of the train and test has been unioned together in one data set and flagged using an "is_train" flag which is true in case of a train record.

The above-mentioned features have been used to properly labels the measurement variables.

For the applied processing, only the variables that hold the application of the statistical mean and standard deviation have been selected.

Activities have been joined with the measurement to form one data set.

Then the labels haven processed to form structured labeling that enables tidying the data based on the data stored in the initial labeling scheme.

Subject identifiers have been joined with the measurement to form one data set.

Then the resultant data set has been tidied in the below format ==>
subject_id --> holds the identifier of the participant 

 $ subject_id : Holds the identifier of the participant identifier.
              : numeric
 $ activity_id: Holds the activity identifier as specified in the original activity_labels.txt.
              : numeric
 $ domain     : Mapped to the domains where the experiment was done under.
              : Factor w/ 2 levels "frequency","time": 1, 2
 $ signal_for : Mapped to the factors that were considered for the experiment.
              : Factor w/ 2 levels "body","gravity": 1, 2
 $ sensor     : Mapped to the sensors used in the experiment.
              : Factor w/ 2 levels "accelerometer","gyroscope": 1, 2
 $ estimate   : Mapped to the statistical methods applied to the measuerments and selected for the data processing.
              : Factor w/ 2 levels "mean","standarddeviation": 1, 2
 $ axe        : Mapped to the 3 axes of the sensors along with NA in case of the value of the Jerk or Magnitude values that are not axial specific.
              : Factor w/ 4 levels "NA","x","y","z": 1, 2, 3, 4
 $ jerk       : Indicates wethere the value of the Jerk signals or not. 
              : logical
 $ magnitude  : Indicates whether the value of the calculated magnitude or not.
              : logical
 $ value      : The actual measurement value.
              : numeric
              
After that, the measurement is grouped by subject_id, activity_id, domain, signal_for, sensor, estimate, axe, jerk, magnitude variables.

Finally, it gets summarized by calculating the average of the measurements over the grouped variables in a variable replacing the value with the below specifications:
 $ average    : Holds the average of the measurements over the grouped variables.
              : numeric
